<p align="center">A NeoBux PTC Bot only for educational purposes written in C++ and QT5<p>

# Context

When I was 20 years old, I bought a book called C++ GUI Programming with QT4, in that year, I had low C++ knowdledge level and I needed improve it. I decided making my own project building a clicking BOT.

# The BOT nowadays

This bot is currently abandoned and it won't have any more new features to improve it, I decided publish it on my GitHub account due NeoBux has made some changes and it doesn't work right now.

# FAQ

I will answer all doubts about it and the most relevant questions, I will publish them on this section
